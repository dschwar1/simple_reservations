# README

This is an example project created for BizzyCar's interview process.

## Requirements

Construct a simple reservation API, that allows an agent to capture customer information, vehicle information, and secure a time slot. Feel free to use any gems that compliment your solution. Additionally include a readme file in your delivery, should include instructions on how to setup and run your project and unit tests that demonstrate functionality.

You do not need to construct a UI, this is intended to be an assessment of your back end skills. As for time commitment, we will leave that up to you. Please deliver a solution in a zipped folder to us when you finish.
We are leaving the details intentionally vague, curious to see the assumptions you make and how you interpret the requirements.
